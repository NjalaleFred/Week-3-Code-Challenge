## DESCRIPTION

This weeks challenge one is supposed to create an application FLATDANGO where one can purchase a movie ticket to go to the theatre.

## SETUP 

The server from which one was to fetch data from is 'http://localhost:3000/films'.

From it one is to fetch data of the first movie and display and it should be the first thing displayed when the page loads. 

Together with it on the left side should be a menu that shows all movies after fetching data. 

Finally one is to be able to buy a ticket by clicking on a button and one should not be able to do so when there are no tickets available. 

As a bonus one should be able to click a movie on the list and its details should be displayed instead of the first movie. 

Also the buy ticket button should show sold out once there are no available movie tickets available.

As an extra deliverable when a ticket is purchased the number of tickets_sold should be persisted

Lastly one should add a delete button that deletes the movie from the list and also on the server.
